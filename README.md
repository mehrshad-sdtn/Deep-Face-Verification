# Deep-Face-Verification
A Deep Learning model utilizing Siamese Networks and CNN for face verification purpose <br>
SBU Computer Vision Fundamentals final project (Fall 2022) 
<br>
### Versions
Two versions were done, The first Version uses LFW dataset, paired manually using random samplin.<br>
Images are resized into 112x112x3 dimensions and a custom CNN architecture was used in each of the Siamese Network Pairs

<br>

The second version utilizes an architecture similiar to VGG-16, with the exception of input images being 60x60x3
Dataset is LFW pairs provided by Scikit-Learn
